            Welcome to my personal website! Here, you'll find my resume and some of my personal 
            projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a third-year Data Science major at Northeastern with a minor in Ethics, originally
            from Santa Cruz, California. Internships have taken me across the country, from 
            Epidemiology research in Iowa City, Iowa, to Resource Planning and Analysis in Seattle,
            Washington, to Software Development for Baseball Operations in Baltimore, Maryland. I look
            forward to completing my degree in 2026 and seeking full-time employment opportunities.

        <h2>Seattle City Light Internship</h2>
        <p>
            During the summer of 2024, I worked as a Power Analyst/Data Science Intern at 
            Seattle City Light, which is the utility within the City of Seattle.
            I was a part of the Resource Planning and Analysis team within the Power Management
            Division. The Resource Planning and Analysis team mainly focused on ---. In addition,
            we worked with other teams in the Power Management Division to understand the
            shorter-term electricity load needs that the City of Seattle has.

            Below, you'll find links to a few of the projects that I worked on at SCL.

        <h2>Ethics and Bioethics Bowl</h2>
        <p>
            As an ethics minor, I have found purpose in participating in Ethics and Bioethics Bowl,
            competitions that are debate-style and bring students together to discuss the ethical
            implications of current issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began competing in Ethics Bowl during my junior year of high school. As president of
            my high school's chapter, I tripled membership and our team's performance improved
            significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now at Northeastern, I have prepped with the Ethics Bowl team, and competed with
            the Bioethics Bowl team at the National Bioethics Bowl competitions for three years
            running.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, youâ€™ll find a few of the cases that I've worked on over the years. 
            From the role of AI in scientific research to the moral permissibility of crowdfunding
            sources, my journey in ethics and bioethics bowl has shaped a big part of who I am today.
